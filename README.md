#Features
	1.	Random Project Ideas: Generate step-by-step project guides for beginner-to-intermediate JavaScript projects.

#Sample Output

{
  "Next": "For user interaction, such as marking tasks as completed, you will need to update the task's state. You can add a 'completed' property to each task object in the array and toggle this value when a task is clicked. Conditional statements help manage these state changes.",
  "output": "State Management: Task Completion"
}
